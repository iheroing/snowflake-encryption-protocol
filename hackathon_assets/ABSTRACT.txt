Project Name: 雪花密语 (Snowflake Whisper)
Team: Solo (Assisted by Kiro)

Description:
Snowflake Whisper is an ephemeral, poetic encryption tool exploring the concept of "Data Impermanence." 

It transforms text messages into unique, fractally generated snowflakes using cryptographic hashes. Built with React 19 and the Web Crypto API, it ensures military-grade AES-256 encryption entirely in the browser. Messages "melt" (self-destruct) after 60 seconds, challenging the modern norm of permanent data storage. 

Developed in under 1 hour with Kiro, utilizing AI for complex fractal algorithm generation and security protocol implementation.

Tech Stack: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Web Crypto API
Key Feature: Text-to-Fractal Visualization, Client-side Encryption, Ephemeral Messaging.
